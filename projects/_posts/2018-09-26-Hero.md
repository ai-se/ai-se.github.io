A software project has “Hero Developers” when 80% of contributions
are delivered by 20% of the developers. Are such heroes a
good idea? Are too many heroes bad for software quality? Is it
better to have more/less heroes for different kinds of projects? To
answer these questions, we studied 661 open source projects from
Public open source software (OSS) Github and 171 projects from
an Enterprise Github.

We find that hero projects are very common. In fact, as projects
grow in size, nearly all projects become hero projects. These findings
motivated us to look more closely at the effects of heroes on
software development. Analysis shows that the frequency to close
issues and bugs are not significantly affected by the presence of
heroes or project type (Public or Enterprise). Similarly, the time
needed to resolve an issue/bug/enhancement is not affected by
heroes or project type. This is a surprising result since, before looking
at the data, we expected that increasing heroes on a project
will slow down how fast that project reacts to change. However,
we do find a statistically significant association between heroes,
project types, and enhancement resolution rates. Heroes do not
affect enhancement resolution rates in Public projects. However,
in Enterprise projects, heroes increase the rate at which projects
complete enhancements.

In summary, our empirical results call for a revision of a longheld
truism in software engineering. Software heroes are far more
common and valuable than suggested by the literature, particularly
for medium to large Enterprise developments. Organizations should
reflect on better ways to find and retain more of these heroes. _[Read More](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3183549)_
