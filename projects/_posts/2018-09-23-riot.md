title:  Stochastic-based Method for Workflow Scheduling in the Cloud

# Definition
Workflow scheduling: figure out the best vm configurations for a workflow in cloud environment, which can balance the service rental cost as well as runtime.

# Method
Traditional workflow scheduling algorithms were based on some heuristics, e.g. reliability greedy, cost greedy, cost-time balancing, etc., or more recently, the meta-heuristic methods, such as genetic algorithms. These methods are very slow and not suitable for rescheduling in the dynamic cloud environment. RIOT (Randomized Instance Order Types) is a stochastic based method for workflow scheduling. RIOT groups the tasks in the workflow into virtual machines via a probability model and then uses an effective surrogate-based method to assess a large amount of potential scheduling
