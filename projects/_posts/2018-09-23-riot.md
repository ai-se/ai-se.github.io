title:  Stochastic-based Method for Workflow Scheduling in the Cloud
layout: page
---

Cloud computing provides engineers or scientists a place to run complex computing tasks. Finding a workflow's deployment configuration in a cloud environment is not easy. Traditional workflow scheduling algorithms were based on some heuristics, e.g. reliability greedy, cost greedy, cost-time balancing, etc., or more recently, the meta-heuristic methods, such as genetic algorithms. These methods are very slow and not suitable for rescheduling in the dynamic cloud environment. This paper introduces RIOT (Randomized Instance Order Types), a stochastic based method for workflow scheduling. RIOT groups the tasks in the workflow into virtual machines via a probability model and then uses an effective surrogate-based method to assess a large amount of potential scheduling. Experiments in dozens of study cases showed that RIOT executes tens of times faster than traditional methods while generating comparable results to other methods.
