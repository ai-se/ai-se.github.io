Optimization has been the goal of almost every human
thought and action. With growing computational
capabilities, solutions to problems are also
exponentially increasing. Literature proves that
with rising demand for data and analytics on this
large data, solutions to problems are
multiplied. These solutions are supported with
strong statistical and analytical reasoning that
does help experts narrow down solutions. Optimizing
these large set of solutions can get tricky to
experts who seek knowledge of how these solutions
have improved and what decisions need to be taken
for remaining solutions to improve. This problem
persists in software engineering with managers and
experts taking decisions which decide the course of
project.

This thesis proposes a method for optimizing
solutions along with providing decisions that help
improve a solution. Literature supports that
landscape visualization of data gives an inside
scoop of data behaviour. A method is proposed which
takes benefit of visualizing data and improving
solutions based on their position in
landscape. Cross Trees are built by grouping data
based on their similarities. Traversing from bad
group of solutions to better group of solutions
require few decisions to taken. These decisions are
proposed by CrossTree and are tested for how valid
they are. CrossTree is tested with two models which
simulate software projects-POM3 and XOMO.  Also,
models are simluated with one of the best genetic
algortihms NSGA-II, to generate set of optimized
solutions. CrossTree is compared against results
from NSGA-II to validate performance.
