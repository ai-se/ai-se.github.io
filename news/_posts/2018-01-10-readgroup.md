In the RAISE reading group, we explore synergies between AI and software engineering. To that end, we conduct a weekly interest group for software engineers and developers at NC State. At the meeting, we read trending papers every week on AI + SE. To get upcoming schedules for our reading group, please visit [this page]({{site.url}}/events/). The reading group is open to the public and free pizza will be provided.
