RAISE reading group continued in the new semester on Jan 10, 2018! Jianfeng Chen presented the paper ["FairFuzz: Targeting Rare Branches to Rapidly Increase Greybox Fuzz Testing Coverage"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.07101). Dozens of graduate students from the Department of Computer Science and Computer Engineering attended and discussed in the meeting.

In the RAISE reading group, we explore synergies between AI and software engineering. To that end, we conduct a weekly interest group for software engineers and developers at NC State. At the meeting, we read trending papers every week on AI + SE. To get upcoming schedules for our reading group, please visit [this page](http://ai4se.net/events/). The reading group is open to the public and free pizza will be provided.
