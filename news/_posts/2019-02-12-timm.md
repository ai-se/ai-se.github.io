Much of the data described in this presentation is drawn from computational science research software, and Tim's research team engaged deeply with the PIs funded by NSF's Software Infrastructure for Sustained Innovation (SI2) program, launched in 2010 to fund software research at multiple scales. This program has included annual PI meetings, where Tim presented and interacted with this developer community. When Tim refers to "you" in this presentation, it is this community of computational science developers/PIs, including but not limited to those in the SI2 program.
