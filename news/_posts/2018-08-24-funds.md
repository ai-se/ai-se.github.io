Abstract: Nothing is permanent, except change. Conclusions made yesterday may now have become overcome by news events. Ideas drift in time, or in space, thus making those conclusions unsafe for future use.  Addressing conclusion safety (by addressing temporal shift and context shift) is an urgent and pressing task. In the AI-aware 21st century, more and more of societyâ€™s interactions are being mediated by models learned from data. Hence, assuring conclusion safety would have application  in very many other organizations.
