AI4SE was granted from LexisNexis in the [Leverage Project](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18oUEAvYtrypvfLCr_SIXjFv56r8ZNamKADBFGC5H2a4/).
This project contains two goals

- *Cloud Computing Optimization* (Improve usage and reduce cost of using cloud compute environments (AWS+Azure))
- *Test Case Prioritization* (Empirically assess the relative merits of different test case prioritization schemes for LexisNexis.)
