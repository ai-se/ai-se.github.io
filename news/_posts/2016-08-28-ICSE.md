Last day for submission to International Conference of Software Engineering-2017 was on Aug 28, 2016. 
This year we have three very interesting papers, which were submitted by [Amrit]({{site.url}}/people/2014/05/17/Amritanshu-Agrawal/), [George]({{site.url}}/people/2014/05/18/George-Mathew/) and [Dr. Menzies]({{site.url}}/people/2014/10/06/Tim-Menzies/). 

The papers are:

+ ["Trends in Topics at SE Conferences (1993-2013)."](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.08100)
+ ["What is Wrong with Topic Modeling?(and How to Fix it Using Search-based SE)."](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.08176)
+ ["A deep learning model for estimating story points"](http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.00489)

Now we wait with our fingers crossed!
