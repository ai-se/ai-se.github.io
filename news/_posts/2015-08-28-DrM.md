Dr. Menzies submits his paper titled "Live and Let Die? (Delayed Issues not Harder to Resolve)" to ICSE 2016. This is a joint work with [Dr. William R. Nichols](https://www.sei.cmu.edu/about/people/profile.cfm?id=nichols_14213), [Dr. Forrest Shull](http://www.sei.cmu.edu/about/people/profile.cfm?id=shull_17917)and [Dr. Lucas Layman](http://www.fc-md.umd.edu/People/LucasLayman). 

**Title:** Live and Let Die? (Delayed Issues not Harder to Resolve)

**Abstract:** Many practitioners and academics believe in a delayed issue effect
(DIE); i.e. as issues linger longer in a system, they become exponentially
harder to resolve. This belief is often used to justify
major investments in new development processes that promise to
retire more issues, sooner.
This paper tests for the delayed issue effect in 171 software projects
conducted around the world in the period from 2006â€“2014. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the largest study yet published on this
effect. We found no evidence for the delayed issue effect; i.e. the
time to resolve issues in a later phase was not consistently more
than when issues were resolved soon after their introduction.
This result begs the question: how many other long-held beliefs
in software engineering are unsupported by current data?
